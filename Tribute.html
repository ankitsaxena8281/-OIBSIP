        <h2>Biography</h2>
        
        <p>
            Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose was born in cuttack, Orissa. His fathers was Janaki Nath Bose and Mother was Prabhavati Devi. He was very much influenced by the teachings of Swami Vivekanand and Ramakrishn. He passed the Indian Civil Service Exam and was also elected as Congress President twice in the year 1938 and 1939, but he wanted to contribute to the Indian freedom struggle. He formed the Azad Hind Foz on 5th july 1943.
            <br>
            Netaji was a man of strong will power. He says that freedom is not given, it needs to be taken and also he was not in the full support of the 'Non-Violence policy'. He visited many countries to ally with them to fight the British government. The alliance of Azad Hind Foz and the Japanese army won many battles against the Britishers. Netaji also wrote a book 'The Great Indian Struggle' to narrate the history of Indian independence movements. He got the inspiration from the 'Bhagavad Geeta' and believed in universal brotherhood.
            <br>
            Recently Prime Minister Narendra Modi also paid tribute to Netaji, and celebrated the Jayanti of Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose i.e., 23 January as 'Parakram Divas'.
